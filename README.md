# DefiLlama Adapters Notifications

This repo contains a script that sends notifications to a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/defillama_adapters) if there are new commits in the [DefiLlama Adapters](https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters) repo.

It leverages GitHub workflows to run the script every 5 minutes, so there is no need to deploy the bot anywhere.
